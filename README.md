Challenges Faced:
- First time application created using handlebars
- Managing data persistence across multiple pages without a backend.
- Ensuring localStorage updates donâ€™t overwrite original JSON data.
- Dynamically binding event listeners to elements loaded via partials.

## Improvements for future
- Add confirmation modals for delete operations.
- Add image/profile support for employees.
- Implement sorting by more fields (e.g., last name).
- Add backend API integration using Node.js or Firebase.
- Form-level accessibility and keyboard navigation enhancements.
